Essays that provide historical context for the writing of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are also presented. In addition, the Charters of Freedom web pages contain biographical profiles of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, and the delegates to the Constitutional Convention (identified as the Founding Fathers on this site). Sections entitled the \"Making of the Charters\" and the \"Impact of the Charters\" focus on topics such as the \"Articles of Confederation,\" the role of slavery in the war for independence, the Civil War, and the rights of suffrage." .
